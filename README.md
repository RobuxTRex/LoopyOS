LoopyOS - Virtual Operating System in the Browser!

LoopyOS is a Virtual Operating Environment in your Browser.
Currently, it is a Work-In-Progress, though, here's a list of what's planned for the future:
- Run any files, without it harming your Physical Environment (your PC)
- Use custom made applciations, including Web Browsers!
- Connect to other environments with permission and interact with their VOE (Virtual Operating Environment)
- Upload files to the VOE, good for testing malicious software and it's effects on your computer (may not work with LoopyOS)
- Access your files from anywhere using anything.

LoopyOS is modern, making it look sleek and fits with the current era of computing virtually (VC - Virtual Computer & PC - Physical Computer)
Have fun with the OS and make sure to open an issue if you have a problem or star and watch if you enjoy this OS.

The term VC should not be mistaken for Voice Call or Video Call.
The term PC should not be mistaken for Personal Computer or Personal Computing.

Thats it; though, the tutorial above was made with Google Chrome, so if it doesn't work for you, that's why.
